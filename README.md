# Space-Battle

A small project developed in C++ language, for the discipline of programming and development at UFMG. 
The project called SpaceBattle, simulates the battle between spaceships in a Cartesian plane.

At the beginning of the program, the user can indicate how many ships he wants to create, then it is possible to indicate the x,y values of the Cartesian plane in which the ships will be positioned, followed by the energy points of each ship.

Following it is possible to simulate a small battle between ships, using the following commands:<br />
**input s:** prints the status of all ships<br />
**input d:** Calculates the distance between all ships<br />
**input a:** allows you to indicate a ship to attack the nearest ship<br />
**input m:** allows to indicate a new position x,y for a ship<br />
**input p:** allows checking the closest ship to the indicated ship<br />
